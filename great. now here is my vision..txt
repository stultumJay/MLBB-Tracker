great. now here is my vision.

the app will be called "MLBB Tracker"
when opened, it should have a name like that with UI. There will be two tabs, "Timer" and "Heroes". The timer one where i can set a timer for five individual hourglass icon that would be used later for overlay, and then the next tab where there will be list of heroes of mobile legends, and have their skill cooldown, but only the ultimate cooldowns for level 1/2/3 ultimate. it should have a name of the skill, and the cooldown of the skill (i.e. Avatar of the Guardian 54.0/ 50.0/ 46.0). great, thats the two tabs.

in the timer tab. there will be a circular shape that would indicate the time when set or clicked. there will be 5 circles. 3 circles for the first column, and 2 for the second column. each circle will have a name above it. the circle is named GOLD, EXP, JUNGLE, MID, ROAM respectively. in the mid and roam, it would have an option below it, that is different from the above.

now, how would i set the time? there will be a button named SET SPELL, this will be the buttons to interact with each circle. though in the mid and roam, there is  a check box which is named "Has PYT", when this checkbox is clicked, i want you to reduce the countdown of the spell of the selected check box by 20percent. for example, the mid has PYT (which means he has pull yourself together, cause with this it will reduce spell countdown) and hes spell is flicker, then the countdown would be 96.

although, just one thing, the jungle default countdown would not be flicker (i.e. 120) but retribution, which has 35 seconds.



Execute (90 s) · Retribution (35 s) · Inspire (75 s) · Sprint (100 s) · Revitalize (100 s) · Aegis (90 s) · Petrify (90 s) · Purify (90 s) · Flameshot (50 s) · Flicker (120 s) · Arrival (75 s) · Vengeance (75 s). (note: i added images in drawable with the battle spell name in lowercase with the file type of jpg in all images)	

though make the default time count down to 120 seconds, like its a flicker spell. and also, the countdown would start with the maximum (i.e. 120 for flicker and down to zero) to minimum. when the countdown is zero (which means i haven't clicked it, use the image in the drawable named hourglass-empty.png and color it green, though when its counting down, use the hourglass-full.png and color it red).


most importantly, the timer tab isn't scrollable, so make sure it fits in one screen. its just the heroes tab that is scrollable.

in the heroes tab. there will be five columns. this five columns will be filled with heroes images. it is group with another row, which is the heroes name. (the heroes are ordered in ascending order). and when the image of the hero is clicked, it would fill one column, that would show the number indicating the cooldown. for example, when i choose something like akai, and he is the first column, when i click his image, it would expand into the second column and show the number. though, it would not rearrange the column when i clicked something, it just expand to show more information, but would not make the columns moves forward. and when its in the fifth column, the expansion would be in the fourth one. (you can base it in the attached pdf, i already put the necessary information for the heroes tab there) The Heroes Tab serves as an interactive catalog of all Mobile Legends heroes, designed for quick access to their ultimate cooldowns. It loads hero data directly from local JSON files within the app’s assets (sourced from the MLBB-API repository), ensuring offline functionality and fast response times. Each hero is displayed in a clean 5-column grid layout that maintains consistent spacing and order, sorted alphabetically by name for easy navigation. Beneath each hero image, the hero’s name is shown, providing immediate visual and textual reference.

When a user taps on a hero’s image, that hero’s card smoothly expands sideways to reveal the cooldown of their ultimate ability, presented in seconds (e.g., “CD: 54s”). This interaction does not disrupt the grid alignment — columns remain fixed, preserving the interface’s visual stability. For heroes positioned at the edge (the fifth column), the expansion gracefully slides toward the left to prevent overflow. This approach ensures both clarity and intuitive user interaction, blending functionality with an organized, game-inspired aesthetic.




then right below all of this timer, there will be two buttons. The left button is named "SHOW" and the right button is named "RESET". When the show button is clicked, it would output an overlay for the timer, and then the app will change the name of show to "HIDE", and when clicked again, the overlay is gone.

and the right button which is named reset, will make all the default battle spell countdown(i.e. 120s, while the third timer for jungle is default 35).

make all button center and designed very well, with appropriate colors indicating the uses.



the overlay icons will be in horizontal, and it has five individual hourglass icon(you can use the icons in the drawable, where ive already inputted. the name is hourglass-full and hourglass-empty, the hourglass is filled in the top and the next png s the hourglass is filled in the bottom.) make them small, small enough that it cant hinder the game, just a speck that i can click it with my thumb.




 
what i want you to do is create a to do list, a plan, and a detailed documentation of how the app works, and the code.
